# Virtual Audio Cable Audio Repeater Manager
##### VAC Audio Repeater Manager (VACARM)
### In Development
Easily multiplex multiple audio sources. Create, manage, and automate
instances of [Virtual Audio Cable](#Licensing) (VAC) audio repeaters. Compatible
with Microsoft Windows 2000 to Windows 11.

## 1. Why?
- Allows for [multiplexing](#71-multiplexing) of audio streams, of which is
not natively supported in Microsoft Windows.
  * If a user wishes to listen to music, a video game, and more, the *same*
audio output must be selected.
  * Windows programs
(example: media players, video games, Internet browsers, etc.) may only choose
one (1) audio output (and input).
- For example, effectively treat a
[video game session](#11-use-case-software-defined-multiplexing) like
[music recording](#12-real-world-equivalent).
- **Turnkey** solution, no tedious work of opening or closing instances of VAC
audio repeater.

### 1.1. Use-Case: Software-Defined Multiplexing
Given:
- one (1) Gaming PC:
  * to play video games.
  * to run VAC Audio Repeater Manager.
  * to capture of the audio/video via a broadcast/stream client.
- three (3) audio sources:
  * a local microphone.
  * incoming voice chat audio.
  * game audio.
- Optional: a separate PC to record; one (1) Recording PC:
  * cables and/or adapters to transfer audio (and video) from the Gaming PC to the
Recording PC.
  * to capture of the audio/video via a broadcast/stream client.

Allows:
1. Specify to only listen to two of the three audio sources
(incoming voice and game audio) on the Gaming PC.
2. Record each source as separate audio streams on a (Gaming or separate) PC,
for future audio/video editing.
3. Optional: capture the audio/video via a broadcast/stream client.

### 1.2. Real-World Equivalent
`(Come on, Dave, give me a break)` - *Unchained*, Van Halen

Given:
- multiple incoming audio sources (instruments and microphones).
- a time-keeping audio source (a Metronome).
- the incoming/outgoing communication between audio engineer and band.

Allows:
- Listen to all sources together, but record separately. 
  * Record all channels from music band separately, for optimal future
remastering.
  * Allow for future editor(s) to mitigate unnecessary audio sources
(time-keeping audio and audio engineer communication) within master recording.

## 2. Features
- Load/Save audio stream setup to/from file.
  - Configuration files
  - `.bat` script files
- Manage audio stream setup of current or other Windows machine(s).
- Start/stop audio repeaters from within the application.
- Easily automate audio stream setup given user-input and/or arguments.

## 3. Requirements
- [VAC Audio Repeater](https://vac.muzychenko.net/en/repeater.htm)
- [VAC Control Panel](https://vac.muzychenko.net/en/download.htm)

### 7.1. Multiplexing
In the scope of this project: one *virtual* Line-In to one or more *physical*
Line-Out(s).

*In telecommunications and computer networking, multiplexing*
*(sometimes contracted to muxing) is a method by which multiple analog or*
*digital signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium.*
